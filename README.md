# University Simple C Starting Code #

This repository contains the completed code for the USCC project, which is a set of five programming assignments to build out a working compiler for a C language subset called USC. These assignments are intended to be completed by undergraduate students, so USCC uses the LLVM framework as its code generation engine.

If you are taking ITP439, you are not allowed to use any of this code for the class.
